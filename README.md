# Template

**My basic html/css template**

[Sample](https://oliverbrotchie.github.io/basic-template)

I use this template for all my projects. It includes my fonts, layout grid and styles. You can see examples of previous versions over on my [Github](https://github.com/OliverBrotchie),[CSS Fingerprint](https://github.com/OliverBrotchie/css-fingerprint-study) and [Interface.js](https://github.com/OliverBrotchie/interface.js).

I try to keep my websites relatively minimalist, opting to use plain HTML and the myriad of modern CSS features whenever possible. My favourite languages are Rust Deno, which I like to use in creation of my scripts and back-end systems. As for front-end interactivity, I aim to handle as much as possible using CSS and back-end interaction, but if Javascript is necessary, my favourite framework is Svelte!
